# Olympic_Dataset_statistics

EDA is perform.

The ‘dataset on the modern Olympic Games’ comprises all the Games from Athens
1986 to Rio 2016. The Olympics is more than just a quadrennial multi-sport
world championship. It is a lens through which to understand global history,
including shifting geopolitical power dynamics, women’s empowerment, and the
evolving values of society.

In this analysis, our goal is to shed light on major patterns in Olympic history.
How many athletes, sports, and nations are there?
Where do most athletes come from?
Who wins medals? 
What are the characteristic of the athletes (e.g., gender and physical size)?


What is EDA ?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their
main characteristics and often plotting them visually. This step is very important
especially when we arrive at modelling the data in order to apply Machine learning.
Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plots, Scatter plots and many more. It often
takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define
the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important.
